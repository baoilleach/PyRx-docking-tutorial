Overview of the AutoDock world
------------------------------

**AutoDock** is a docking program
- Open Source, freely available

**AutoGrid** is part of AutoDock
- Creates the grids for use in docking

**Vina** is another docking program
- Faster (and claims to be more accurate) than AutoDock

**ADT (AutoDockTools)** is a GUI for setting up and analysing AutoDock dockings
- Been around a while - a bit clunky - quite powerful though

**PyRx** is a GUI for setting up and analysing AutoDock and Vina dockings
- Relatively new - easy to use - works well - doesn't have all the features of ADT
- If you are interested in new features, ask for them on the forum
